Events leading upto the ride:
As the new year was approaching with no plans made, I was thinking of what to do for the new year. In the final week of december I
was with my family touring in idduki and munnar. One fine night, Sampu called and enquired as to what to do. Few things were
fixed ie. it has to be a bike ride and it will be Balnagu, Kishore, Sampu and me. So we went ahead and booked bikes. I wanted to
try out the Mahindra Mojo. So a mojo, a classic and a thunderbird were booked with the destination still not fixed. I too booked a
bus from Allepey to Bangalore and the ride was to be commenced on the 31st.

The day before the ride:
I got into the bus and reached silk board on morning 7. 

The ride:
I reached ciroc and saw the bikes in full glory. We all were still thinking where exactly to go. Finally we fixed on Coorg and I
was relieved as I had not called home and told where I am headed to. So made a quick call to my dad , BIL and amma. I and Balnagu
muscled up to start the cold engine of the classic which was not starting with electric nor with kick start. Balnagu then pushed
it and we were able to finally breathe life into the engine. With the engines roaring, intercoms working and the luggages tied, we
were all set for our epic journey that lied in front of us. There was a red bag containing slippers that was tied to my bike. As
we just got past ciroc it fell off and was taken up by Sampu. There were some issues with the bikes. The classic had trouble
starting up once it is stopped and the thunderbird's console was shaking way too much while riding. Our first destination was a
breakfast point were we will be meeting up with Akhil and Alekhya. So we headed up and had our breakfast there. After our tummies
were full, we resumed the journey. I was just waiting to skip the damn Bangalore traffic and hit the highways. As we were
negotiating the traffic, with Sampu and Balnagu in front and Kishore in the back, I was met with a minor accident. A person in
bike came and hit me on the right side, while I was blind sided by an auto. I didnt even keep my feet on the road and I continued
and stopped at a petrol bunk 20m ahead to fill air. Kishore came to us and told about how the guy fell and something broke off my
bike and he went in the search for me. On inspecting the bike more closely I noticed that the fins of radiator guards were broken
and there was some damage to the radiator. Initially I was little dissapointed but when Sampu told we will look into it when we
handover the bike at rental I forgot about it and focussed on enjoying the ride. It was surprising as I thought we just brushed
each others vehicle. Thanks to the weigth of mojo, it didnt topple over. We entered some Mysore-Bangalore highway which was very
wide and was made up of cement. My joy was short lived when we had to take a left from the main highway. We were reliving some
memories as we passed through the same spots when we went for convocation. We took few breaks for drinking coconut water and
sugarcane juice. Everytime I stopped, I had to make 3 calls to update everyone of my location. After continuing on highway, Sampu
stopped for a break where we found to our horror that the console of thunderbird has come off. The only thing holding it in place
were the wires. We somehow tied the console in its place with a rope. Soon we entered a single lane state highway and we were
already feeling hungry. We stopped when we spotted a hotel. The ride was becoming more pleasant as the peak sun of the afternoon
was slowly fading away. We all then took a break at a petrol bunk. There Sampu was trying to book an accomodation for us. We took
a long and liesure break, ate some oranges and after contacting each and every homestay number available on Sampu's mobile and
fixing one, we finally resumed the journey. The sun was setting and the cold increased as fast as it got dark. It was soon
apparant that it will be pretty late in the night when we reach our homestay. We were all battling the dark and the cold while
riding and on crossing a town, we stopped for dinner. We didnt even have a clue as how much more challenging the remaining ride
was. After refuelling ourselves with the food, we started the final leg of the ride to reach Coorg. I truly do not have words for
how awesome the road leading up to Coorg was. The ghat section had not yet began. The road was cutting through the forest and was
smooth as silk and there was no one apart from us. That strech of road was pure bliss. As we proceded, the raods started to become
more curvy and sloping upwards and even before we knew we were climbing a hill covered with coffee plantations. Just like a
chequered flag means end of a race, those plantations signified that we had finally entered Coorg. The road to the homestay was a
spiralling up a hill. Now we undertook the daunting task of riding uphill on a raod filled with stones and gravel, in tatol pitch
dark, with shivering cold being a constant companion. The signal for navigation had been long gone and we were lucky that Balnagu
hadnt exited out of the maps, unintentionally saving the route. With Balnagu navigatind in front of me, he finally stopped and
told that according to google maps we had reached the homestay. That was panicking as we were literally in middle of nowhere. At
some distance, I spotted some light and we decided to go there, thinking that might be our place for the night. As we passed
through the gates of that home, we were thanking our lucky stars that the dog that was relentlessly barking at us on hearing our
bikes noises was tied down. Soon a family of 3 emerged from the house and on telling the name of our homestay they pointed us to
the right direction. I felt bad as we woke up the whole family but then we didnt had much option. On going down a little further,
we spotted the board for the homestay that we had missed. We finally entered our rooms and there was a bonfire waiting for us. 

We then sat around the fire, had few carrom games and went to get some sleep. Next morning after the breakfast, on recommendation
of the homestay lady, we went to malahali waterfalls. We had decided to go to Hogenakkal on the return journey to Bangalore. The
return path from the waterfall was through lush green ghat roads, that I was riding with a smile on my face. We reached Mysore at
9pm, contemplating wheter to continue or stay as it will become very late when we reach Hogenakkal, that too we didnt have any
rooms booked yet. We saw that there are some cheap OYO's available. So we decided to spend the night there and continue the ride
early morning. Following day we understood how good of a decision that was. Next day we started our ride in bone chilling cold
during dawn. We stopped for some coffee and sped our way to Hogenakkal. We were able to maintain very good speed as there was
hardly anyone at that time of the day and the raods were good. I felt good when the sun started rising revealing the pictursque
landscape around us. On entering Tamilnadu, prompted by the sudden increase in palm trees, the sun was out in its full glory. We
were on a road which passed through a forest and had its fair share of haripins. After spotting many animal crossing warning we
saw a stream of water, gushing its way through several boulders. After few more kilometers we were at our destination. We had our
breakfast and booked a boat ride. After everyting was over we had meals and set out for the final leg of the ride. On our way back
we stopped at crocodile park. Interestingly they were so still, one can pass them off as statues. 

Returning to Bangalore, we stopped for few clicks. We faced very bad traffic right as we were entering Bangalore and it was hard
keeping up with Kishore. Through the dark and the dust, we were able to ride at that night. Following the maps, we found
oursleves riding through long strecthes of partially made roads filled with gravel. On passing that, we were finally in Bangalore.
We went to ciroc and then picked up helmets to drop at the rentals. Luckily the rental guy didnt notice the damage in mojo and he
was very understanding of the console situation of the thunderbird. We booked a cab to return to ciroc, marking the end of our
epic new year ride and beginning of 2019 :)
