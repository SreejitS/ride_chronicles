Events leading upto the ride:
As the new year was approaching with no plans made, I was thinking of what to do for the new year. In the final week of december I was with my family touring in idduki and munnar. One fine night, Sampu called and enquired as to what to do. Few things were fixed ie. it has to be a bike ride and it will be Balnagu, Kishore, Sampu and me. So we went ahead and booked bikes. I wanted to try out the Mahindra Mojo. So a mojo, a classic and a thunderbird were booked with the destination still not fixed. I too booked a bus from Allepey to Bangalore and the ride was to be commenced on the 31st.

The day before the ride:
I got into the bus and reached silk board on morning 7. 

The ride:
I reached ciroc and saw the bikes in full glory. We all were still thinking where exactly to go. Finally we fixed on Coorg and I was relieved as I had not called home and told where I am headed to. So made a quick call to my dad , BIL and amma. I and Balnagu muscled up to start the cold engine of the classic which was not starting with electric nor with kick start. Balnagu then pushed it and we were able to finally breathe life into the engine. With the engines roaring, intercoms working and the luggages tied, we were all set for our epic journey that lied in front of us. There was a red bag containing slippers that was tied to my bike. As we just got past ciroc it fell off and was taken up by Sampu. There were some issues with the bikes. The classic had trouble starting up once it is stopped and the thunderbird's console was shaking way too much while riding. Our first destination was a breakfast point were we will be meeting up with Akhil and Alekhya. So we headed up and had our breakfast there. After our tummies were full, we resumed the journey. I was just waiting to skip the damn Bangalore traffic and hit the highways. As we were negotiating the traffic, with Sampu and Balnagu in front and Kishore in the back, I was met with a minor accident. A person in bike came and hit me on the right side, while I was blind sided by an auto. I didnt even keep my feet on the road and I continued and stopped at a petrol bunk 20m ahead to fill air. Kishore came to us and told about how the guy fell and something broke off my bike and he went in the search for me. On inspecting the bike more closely I noticed that the fins of radiator guards were broken and there was some damage to the radiator. Initially I was little dissapointed but when Sampu told we will look into it when we handover the bike at rental I forgot about it and focussed on enjoying the ride. It was surprising as I thought we just brushed each others vehicle. Thanks to the weigth of mojo, it didnt topple over. We entered some Mysore-Bangalore highway which was very wide and was made up of cement. My joy was short lived when we had to take a left from the main highway. We were reliving some memories as we passed through the same spots when we went for convocation. We took few breaks for drinking coconut water and sugarcane juice. Everytime I stopped, I had to make 3 calls to update everyone of my location.
