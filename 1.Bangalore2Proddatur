Events leading upto the ride:
Things began when I and Sampu discovered that we both had a common passion for long distance motorbike riding. We used to discuss some interesting routes that we can ride together like Rajasthan, Ladakh, Mysore etc. After graduating out of college, like as a tradition, I travelled to Bangalore for New Year. This year was no different. As the new year approached, plans were being made. I vividly remember when i got a coll from Sampu and him telling me the plan to surprise Kishore, who was in Kaddapa(RTPPS), on his birthay, date being 28th december. My date of visiting Bangalore, Sampu renting a classic 350, me buying some basic safety gear for the ride, all of which was decided and confirmed in the short span of the call. I was for sure very excited for my first long distance bike ride with my buddy.

The day before the ride:
After reaching Bangalore, all that was in my mind was the ride and the new pair of gloves that i was planning to purchase. This was my first gear in the list of safety gears that wished to buy. We went to Lalbagh and bought a pair of BBG full gauntlet gloves and a balaclava. In the evening, went to Royal Brothers Rentals and picked up the classic 350. We were all set for the ride.
