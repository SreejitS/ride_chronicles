Events leading upto the ride:
Well, wanted to do a trip with Pranav, as he was leaving India for his MS. As with all the things, this was in my mind for a long time. After a series of frustrating days of work on the go-board, I was desperate to go for a trip. One fine day, while eating choclate ice-cream on the terrace, I called up Sampu, and told that we should ride soon. One thing led to another and I was on a conference call with Pranav, Sampu and Sasi and the place was decided to be Pondicherry. Me and Sasi were to start from Hyderabad and go to Bangalore. Few days later Vishwak, Akhil, Ashish and Kishore joined and the place was changed to Goa. We took Pranav's swift and rented out dominar400 for the ride. I and Sasi reached Bangalore a day before just to surprise them :)

The day before the ride:
Went to pick up the dominar400 but it was in a terrible condition. So changed the booking to avenger220. Going with the flow, took sunglasses from Sujji, jacket from Gangu and shoes from Sampu. Didnt had a decent helmet for the ride.
