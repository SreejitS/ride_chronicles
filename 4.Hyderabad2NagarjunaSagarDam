Events leading upto the ride:
Had read on xbhp forum that pre-monsoon and post-monsoon were the best riding season in India. This was stuck in my mind through
out the ghastly summer season. Owning nothing more than a pair of gloves as my safety gear, it was time to buy the rider's crown,
the helmet. This was in my mind for a long time. I visited a riding accessories shop, dynamic ryders in jublie hills. That was a
great day. Came to know that my head size is medium(56.6cm around). After trying several helmets, I was thoroughly blown away by
the comfort offered by Bell Qualifer. Though it was not the safest of the lot, the comfort was unparalleled. I was satisfied with
the feel,weight and double D-ring. Price was 8000/-. Though I had a budget of 6000/- in my mind, I was already thiking of
scrapping it and going for the Bell. But, I was not happy with the fact that it was a polyarbonate shell. After few days and
talking to Abhilash regarding whether to go for polycarb or fibreglass, he was able to convince me to go for the polycarb one for
now and upgrade it later after may years. One day, having nothing to do in office,I decided to go Gear Up store in Secunderabad. I
finally purchased the Bell Qualifier. I was thiking of a long ride to test it. Moreover the monsoon was fast approaching. The
timing couldnt have been more perfect.

The day before the ride:
It was a cloudy day. I was siting in the office and realised that I could take few days off. Decided to test the helmet. Booked
dominar400 to be picked up from Prasads's IMAX. Abhilash dropped me at Dilsuknagar and then I booked a cab to Prasads's IMAX.
Finally picked up the bike, filled petrol till full-tank and rode it home. Bought some choclates and biscuits for the ride. This
was going to be my first solo ride.

The ride: 
I woke up at 4:30 in the dawn. Got ready and started the ride by 5. There was light rain drizzling by then. I rode with the visor
open half way to avoid water hitting my eyes and to prevent fogging. Though Abhilash had warned be about the trucks that would be
filling up the highway space at that time, I was lucky to see that all of the truck traffic was on the opposite lane. It was an
easy ride, mostly empty and straight roads with good amount of greenry around. Every half an hour or so, I used to pass through a
small village/town. Also came to know later that the word "thanda", which was the suffix to a lot of village's name, meant tribal
village. I was smilling and singing as I rode because the weather was exactly the way i wanted it to be. After making my first
mini stop at 80km since I began, called my parents and told them that I have started the ride and am doing fine. One of the
dominar's feature gave me a bit of panic attack. After deciding to continue with the ride, I put the bike in neutral, fired up the
engine and as soon as I put on the first gear the bike switched off. For a moment I thought I will be there for a while. After a
couple of tries, noticed that the secondary console on the tank had the words "SIDE STAND" in red, screaming at me for being an
idiot. Realising it, kicked back the side stand in and was on the road in no time. Finally after doing 70km more I was able to see
the glimpse of Nagarjuna Sagar and was there by 8. I was on a bridge from where you can seen the dam in all of its glory. Saw some
steps near the bank of the river(krishna), took the bike there, sat and ate choclate while staring into the river taking in all
tranquility around me.
Decided to continue down the route for some more kilometers. After the bridge, I was greeted with an empty AP-Telangana border
checkpost. Just after an 2km into the ride, saw a board for Ethipothala waterfalls. Paying 10/-, I gained access to the road that
lead to the falls. After riding 3km of good tarmac, I saw a temple and a garden, serving as an entrance for the waterfalls. Since,
the guy had no change, I thought of seeing this on my way back as I wanted to do as much riding done before the heat kicks in. The
view around the roads of AP were more spread out wide and I was able to see very far till some distant mountains with lush green
fields encompassing the roads. The roads kept on getting narrower and narrower as I continued. Suddenly all I can see were thick
green bushes extending into top of small hills. I was excited for this part of the ride as it knew I was riding through Nallamala
forest. The roads were all curvy and it was a bit challenging because in a unfortunate situation when a bus/truck came opposite
direction, I have to get down the road to let them pass through. Again passed through many small villages and large herds of
cattles in middle of the road. After riding about 70km from the dam, I had crossed the forest section with narrow raods and was
happy that I was back on the wide and empty NH565. I had emptied half of the fuel tank by now and realised that I have to fill up
here as I will be having a long day if I got stuck in the forest, in middle of nowhere. So, I topped up the tank and continued the
journey. As I neared around 230km on the odometer, I remembered that I have a 480km limit on this bike and then I decided to take
a U-turn and start return journey. I again encounterd the all familiar forest route but this time the sun was at the top and I was
taking frequent stops to rehydrate myself. This time on crossing the border, I was stopped by the police and they were enquring
about my bag. As I started the ritual of taking of the velcro straps on the god awful safe gloves and then super tight fiting
helmet, he asked me to just go and let me off, probably feeling sympathatic of my struggles. As the lunch time approached, I
decided to stop for food but was unable to find any good resturants. Finally, after crossing the dam there was a decent place to
eat, where I had 6 pulkas and egg curries. Now with my tummy full I continued my ride only to be welcomed by very pleasant and
cloudy weather. The heat had gone down. As I was passing through avenues and the empty roads, I started to feel lethargic, cause
of all the food I just ate. So I decided to stop for a small power nap on the road side. And that was one hell of a good decision
as I was fully refreshed after a 10min nap and was ecstatic to be back on the road. Whenever I do a trip, on the return ride I
always try to take a mental screenshot the scenery around as something to remember. This time I remembered the avenues, the mango
plantations along side the road and people selling them, a ground with many flags each having their own color, kids playing
cricket ....
Rest of the journey was uneventful untill I was 30km from home at Ibrahimpatnam and Abhilash called me. It was decided to meetup
and go to MacD and then I will go further to return the bike at IMAX. Return of the bike marked the end of this ride for me but
still had a small adventure while returning to home as I struggled to find bus back home. That story is for another day.
