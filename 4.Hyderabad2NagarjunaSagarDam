Events leading upto the ride:
Had read on xbhp forum that pre-monsoon and post-monsoon were the best riding season in India. This was stuck in my mind through out the ghastly summer season. Owning nothing more than a pair of gloves as my safety gear, it was time to buy the rider's crown, the helmet. This was in my mind for a long time. I visited a riding accessories shop, dynamic ryders in jublie hills. That was a great day. Came to know that my head size is medium(56.6cm around). After trying several helmets, I was thoroughly blown away by the comfort offered by Bell Qualifer. Though it was not the safest of the lot, the comfort was unparalleled. I was satisfied with the feel,weight and double D-ring. Price was 8000/-. Though I had a budget of 6000/- in my mind, I was already thiking of scrapping it and going for the Bell. But, I was not happy with the fact that it was a polyarbonate shell. After few days and talking to Abhilash regarding whether to go for polycarb or fibreglass, he was able to convince me to go for the polycarb one for now and upgrade it later after may years. One day, having nothing to do in office,I decided to go Gear Up store in Secunderabad. I finally purchased the Bell Qualifier. I was thiking of a long ride to test it. Moreover the monsoon was fast approaching. The timing couldnt have been more perfect.

The day before the ride:
It was a cloudy weather. I was siting in the office and realised that I could take few days off. Decided to test the helmet. Booked dominar400 to be picked up from Prasads's IMAX. Abhilash dropped me at Dilsuknagar and then I booked a cab to Prasads's IMAX. Finally picked up the bike, filled petrol till full-tank and rode it home. Bought some choclates and biscuits for the ride.
