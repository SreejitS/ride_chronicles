Events leading upto the ride:
Returning with Loki, after celebrating new year in Bangalore with everyone, we decided to do atleast one ride together before he goes to Delhi for his IAS prep. Fast forward three months, I remebered it and called up Loki and planned to go for a ride. The date was decided and I booked a classic 350 from Royal Brothers. Abhilash decided to come along. So it was set. Me, Abhilash, Loki, RE classic350 and yamaha R1 were going to Bidar.

The day before the ride:
Went to Hitec city to pick up the bike with Abhilash. Met Loki, decided IIIT-H to be the meeting point for the next day. Then we split up and headed to Akhilesh and Prateek's place for dinner and rode back to home along the ORR, in the cool night. That ride reminded me of the short bike trips that we used to make to Mukkam when we were in college.
