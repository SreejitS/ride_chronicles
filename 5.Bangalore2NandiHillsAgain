Events leading upto the ride: 
This is by far the most unexpected and in the spur of the moment ride I ever did. Well a lot of things on that day were on the
spur of the moment to say the least. I was going back to Hyderabad after visiting my home in Aleppey.I had to catch a flight to
Pune the next day. I had a layover in Bangalore for 6 hours. After getting into lounge and feeling bored I called up Sampu and
were chatting. He suddenly asked me to come to ciroc and we will book a ticket to pune from bangalore. After few moments of
checking the availablilty and booking it, I got out of airport and caught a bus to hoodi circle. 

The day before the ride:
That evening while roaming aimlessly around, Sampu suggested to go to nandi hills the next day. Calls were made,bikes were
arranged. Gixxer form TVSN and avenger from a friend of Sampu.The guy with avenger showed us how to use the keys and told us
about the headlight switch that needs constant push to be on. That night though i slept okaish..sampu didnt sleep at all and that
fucker didnt let me also. So we decided to start in the early dawn.

The ride:
We started the ride. I was on Gixxer and Sampu on the avenger. He knew the route so he was leading. Meanwhile I was remembering
all the spots from our previous attempt to go nandi hill...hebbal,flyovers,decathlon..etc.After the toll the police stopped us
for checking. We have been informed about this by Balanagu the previous day. We showed the license and insurance papers. But the
papers were expired and I called up TVSN to send the new papers via whatsapp. The Gixxer was a AP registered vehicle and there was
no NOC for it. The police asked for it and we said they are being sent. By this time the police had stopped quite a few bikes
behind us. In the chaos, we showed him some papers and talked fast and confident and he just let us go as he had to deal with a
lot more guys behind us. That was lucky. After dodging the fine , we stopped after some time and had tea. We continued onto the
highway. We had to take a left from the highway to reach the hills. We spotted couple of more riders, who were mostly going to the
same palce. It was at this time the views gradually turned more scenic.Thick grey clouds blanketing around lush green mountains
were just the signs of what is yet to come. We finally reached by 5.50am and there was a crowd waiting for the gate to open,which
generally opens at 6am. By 6.15 people lost the patience and were honking madly that the security opened the gate for us to move
forward and we started moving slowly on the ghat roads. Sun had not come up all the way, so the light was sparse. The roads were
wet due to constant drizzling. The visiblity was very low, all you could see is greyish fog. We reached the top,parked the bikes
and had a hot cup of coffee. The wheather was chilling and the constant rain and strong winds weren't helping a lot. The place was
mesmerising to say the least. Sampu has come to this place quite a few times and yet he told he has never seen this place like
this, amid monsoon cloud,strong cool breeze and greenery all around us. It was something what i would have imagined hill stations
to look like in movies. We spent some time taking it all in. walked around and chilled at an awesome viewpoint. At 7 am or so, we
decided to go back and have some breakfast on the way. Our ride on the way down felt very different than the one up. The sun was
up so we were able to see the streches of land that were hiding behing the dense fog of the morning. I was all ecstatic on the way
down. After joining the highway, we stopped for breakfast. We switched the bikes as i wanted to ride the avenger also. Sampu had
not noticed that the indicator of the avenger was broken. On crossing a flyover near the city, Sampu stopped me for asking that.
While stopping the avenger gave out a wierd noise and it stalled. We were at the top point of the floyover and with every
bus/truck passing we could feel the road beneath us shivering and wombling. That felt scary. With the help of bypassing commuter,
avenger was gently pushed down the slope of the flyover and was able to start again. We continued our ride through the city
traffic. On spotting a decathlon, I remembered that Pranav has told Sampu to buy raincoat for him as we were leaving for Pune the
next day. After purchasing we headed back to home and slept nicely till evening. And thus, Nand Hills was finally conquered :)
